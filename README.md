# WIP hobby os
Kernel requires a i386 32bit version of gcc and binutils

Bootloader is in NASM syntax

This probally will never be able to be ran on actual hardware, but it works in qemu :)

## Issues
Note that this probally won't work on real hardware, or in most vm's.
if you have issues that are not on real hardware, you can message me on discord.
my usename is `tkpmonke`
